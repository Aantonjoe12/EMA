### Crypto EMA Trading Bot
    
A Python bot that uses **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** for BTC/USDT trend-following trading.
    
This project demonstrates fetching historical cryptocurrency data, calculating EMA, generating buy/sell signals, backtesting, and visualizing trading results.
    
## Features
- Fetches live and historical BTC/USDT data using CCXT library
- Calculates EMA using Pandas library
- Generates **BUY / SELL / HOLD signals** based on trend-following logic
- Backtests strategy performance on historical data
- Visualizes BTC price, EMA, and trade signals using Matplotlib library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Aantonjoe12/EMA
cd EMA_Trend_Following
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
---
## Usage
   
1. Run the Python script: python Trend_Following.py
    
2. Or open Jupyter Lab, to run the code interactively: jupyter lab Trend_Following.ipynb

3. The bot will fetch BTC/USDT data, calculate EMA, generate signals, backtest the strategy, and plot results.
 
 
## Example Plot
